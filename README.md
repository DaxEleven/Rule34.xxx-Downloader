Application for downloading content from site Rule34.xxx. Allows you to download both images and videos.

###### Requires [.NET Framework 4.8.1 (runtime)](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet-framework/net481) *most likely you have this unless you are that ancient dinosaur that uses Windows 7 without updates

Although using a certain filter when searching you can get safe content (`rating:safe`), basically the application allows you to access erotic and/or pornographic content. Use it at your own risk, taking into account the laws of the country in which you are located.
